# R-project-with-Power-Bi
Here we have used R in Google colabs along with Power BI to clean and visualize the data set 'HollywoodsMostProfitableStories'
In our recent project, we harnessed the power of R programming in Google Colab to meticulously clean the ‘HollywoodsMostProfitableStories’ dataset. This approach allowed us to take advantage of Colab’s robust computational environment and R’s extensive data manipulation libraries. Following the data cleansing process, we utilized Power BI to transform the refined data into compelling visual narratives. The synergy between R’s data processing capabilities and Power BI’s dynamic visualization tools enabled us to uncover and present insightful trends and patterns within the entertainment industry, offering a clear window into what drives profitability in Hollywood storytelling.


Here there are the scripts detailing the process of what code we used and how we visualized it after cleaning before exporting to Power BI for a refined visualization.
